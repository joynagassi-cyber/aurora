Create structured interview plans to evaluate candidates consistently and fairly.

## Interview Design Principles

1. **Structured**: Same questions for all candidates in the role
2. **Competency-based**: Map questions to specific skills and behaviors
3. **Evidence-based**: Use behavioral and situational questions
4. **Diverse panel**: Multiple perspectives reduce bias
5. **Scored**: Use rubrics, not gut feelings

## Interview Plan Components

### Role Competencies
Define 4-6 key competencies for the role (e.g., technical skills, communication, leadership, problem-solving).

### Question Bank
For each competency, provide:
- 2-3 behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time...")
- 1-2 situational questions ("How would you handle...")
- Follow-up probes

### Scorecard
Rate each competency on a consistent scale (1-4) with clear descriptions of what each level looks like.

### Debrief Template
Structured format for interviewers to share findings and make a decision.

## Output

Produce a complete interview kit: panel assignment (who interviews for what), question bank by competency, scoring rubric, and debrief template.$body$),

## If Connectors Available

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull new hire details and team org chart
- Auto-populate tools access list based on role

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Link to relevant onboarding docs, team wikis, and runbooks
- Pull the team's existing onboarding checklist to customize

If **~~calendar** is connected:
- Create Day 1 calendar events and Week 1 meeting invites automatically

## Tips

1. **Customize for the role** — An engineer's onboarding looks different from a designer's.
2. **Don't overload Day 1** — Focus on setup and relationships. Deep work starts Week 2.
3. **Assign a buddy** — Having a go-to person who isn't their manager makes a huge difference.$body$),

Help plan organizational structure, headcount, and team design.

## Planning Dimensions

- **Headcount**: How many people do we need, in what roles, by when?
- **Structure**: Reporting lines, span of control, team boundaries
- **Sequencing**: Which hires are most critical? What's the right order?
- **Budget**: Headcount cost modeling and trade-offs

## Healthy Org Benchmarks

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning Sign |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Span of control | 5-8 direct reports | < 3 or > 12 |
| Management layers | 4-6 for 500 people | Too many = slow decisions |
| IC-to-manager ratio | 6:1 to 10:1 | < 4:1 = top-heavy |
| Team size | 5-9 people | < 4 = lonely, > 12 = hard to manage |

## Output

Produce org charts (text-based), headcount plans with cost modeling, and sequenced hiring roadmaps. Flag structural issues like single points of failure or excessive management overhead.$body$),

## If Connectors Available

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull prior review history and goal tracking data
- Pre-populate employee details and current role information

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Pull completed work and contributions for the review period
- Reference specific tickets and project milestones as evidence

## Tips

1. **Be specific** — "Great job" isn't feedback. "You reduced deploy time 40% by implementing the new CI pipeline" is.
2. **Balance positive and constructive** — Both are essential. Neither should be a surprise.
3. **Focus on behaviors, not personality** — "Your documentation has been incomplete" vs. "You're careless."
4. **Make development actionable** — "Improve communication" is vague. "Present at the next team all-hands" is actionable.$body$),

## How to Answer

1. Search ~~knowledge base for the relevant policy document
2. Provide a clear, plain-language answer
3. Quote the specific policy language
4. Note any exceptions or special cases
5. Point to who to contact for edge cases

**Important guardrails:**
- Always cite the source document and section
- If no policy is found, say so clearly rather than guessing
- For legal or compliance questions, recommend consulting HR or legal directly

## Tips

1. **Ask in plain language** — "Can I work from Europe for a month?" is better than "international remote work policy."
2. **Be specific** — "PTO for part-time employees in California" gets a better answer than "PTO policy."$body$),

---

### Topic Brief

Research and brief on a specific legal question or topic across available sources.

#### Workflow

1. Accept the topic query from the user
2. Search across connected sources:
   - **Documents**: Internal memos, prior analyses, playbooks, precedent
   - **Email**: Prior communications on the topic
   - **Chat**: Team discussions about the topic
   - **CLM**: Related contracts or clauses
3. Synthesize findings into a structured brief

### Gaps
[What information is missing or what sources were not available]

### Recommended Next Steps
[What the user should do with this information]
```

#### Important Notes
- Topic briefs synthesize what is available in connected sources; they do not substitute for formal legal research
- If the topic requires current legal authority or case law, recommend the user consult a legal research platform (Westlaw, Lexis, etc.) or outside counsel
- Always note the limitations of the sources searched

---

### Incident Brief

Rapid briefing for developing situations that require immediate legal attention (data breaches, litigation threats, regulatory inquiries, IP disputes, etc.).

#### Workflow

1. Accept the incident topic or description
2. Rapidly scan all connected sources for relevant context:
   - **Email**: Communications about the incident
   - **Chat**: Real-time discussions and escalations
   - **Documents**: Relevant policies, response plans, insurance coverage
   - **Calendar**: Scheduled response meetings
   - **CLM**: Affected contracts, indemnification provisions, insurance requirements
3. Compile into an actionable incident brief

#### Output Format

```
## Incident Brief: [Topic]
**Prepared**: [timestamp]
**Classification**: [severity assessment if determinable]

### Situation Summary

[What is not yet known and needs to be determined]

### Sources Checked
[What was searched and what was not available]
```

#### Important Notes for Incident Briefs
- Speed matters. Produce the brief quickly with available information rather than waiting for complete information
- Flag any litigation hold or preservation obligations immediately
- Note privilege considerations (mark the brief as attorney-client privileged / work product if appropriate)
- If the incident may involve a data breach, flag applicable notification deadlines (e.g., 72 hours for GDPR)
- Recommend outside counsel engagement if the matter is significant

## General Notes

- If sources are unavailable, note the gaps prominently so the user knows what was not checked
- For daily briefs, learn the user's preferences over time (what they find useful, what they want filtered out)
- Briefs should be actionable: every item should have a clear next step or reason for inclusion
- Keep briefs concise. Link to source materials rather than reproducing them in full$body$),

## DPA Review Checklist

When reviewing a Data Processing Agreement or Data Processing Addendum, verify the following:

### Required Elements (GDPR Article 28)

- [ ] **Subject matter and duration**: Clearly defined scope and term of processing
- [ ] **Nature and purpose**: Specific description of what processing will occur and why
- [ ] **Type of personal data**: Categories of personal data being processed
- [ ] **Categories of data subjects**: Whose personal data is being processed
- [ ] **Controller obligations and rights**: Controller's instructions and oversight rights

### Processor Obligations

- [ ] **Process only on documented instructions**: Processor commits to process only per controller's instructions (with exception for legal requirements)
- [ ] **Confidentiality**: Personnel authorized to process have committed to confidentiality
- [ ] **Security measures**: Appropriate technical and organizational measures described (Article 32 reference)
- [ ] **Sub-processor requirements**:
  - [ ] Written authorization requirement (general or specific)
  - [ ] If general authorization: notification of changes with opportunity to object
  - [ ] Sub-processors bound by same obligations via written agreement
  - [ ] Processor remains liable for sub-processor performance
- [ ] **Data subject rights assistance**: Processor will assist controller in responding to data subject requests
- [ ] **Security and breach assistance**: Processor will assist with security obligations, breach notification, DPIAs, and prior consultation
- [ ] **Deletion or return**: On termination, delete or return all personal data (at controller's choice) and delete existing copies unless legal retention required
- [ ] **Audit rights**: Controller has right to conduct audits and inspections (or accept third-party audit reports)
- [ ] **Breach notification**: Processor will notify controller of personal data breaches without undue delay (ideally within 24-48 hours; must enable controller to meet 72-hour regulatory deadline)

### International Transfers

### Common DPA Issues

| Issue | Risk | Standard Position |
|---|---|---|
| Blanket sub-processor authorization without notification | Loss of control over processing chain | Require notification with right to object |
| Breach notification timeline > 72 hours | May prevent timely regulatory notification | Require notification within 24-48 hours |
| No audit rights (or audit rights only via third-party reports) | Cannot verify compliance | Accept SOC 2 Type II + right to audit upon cause |
| Data deletion timeline not specified | Data retained indefinitely | Require deletion within 30-90 days of termination |
| No data processing locations specified | Data could be processed anywhere | Require disclosure of processing locations |
| Outdated SCCs | Invalid transfer mechanism | Require current EU SCCs (2021 version) |

## Data Subject Request Handling

### Request Intake

When a data subject request is received:

1. **Identify the request type**:
   - Access (copy of personal data)
   - Rectification (correction of inaccurate data)
   - Erasure / deletion ("right to be forgotten")
   - Restriction of processing
   - Data portability (structured, machine-readable format)
   - Objection to processing
   - Opt-out of sale/sharing (CCPA/CPRA)
   - Limit use of sensitive personal information (CPRA)

2. **Identify applicable regulation(s)**:
   - Where is the data subject located?
   - Which laws apply based on your organization's presence and activities?
   - What are the specific requirements and timelines?

3. **Verify identity**:
   - Confirm the requester is who they claim to be
   - Use reasonable verification measures proportionate to the sensitivity of the data
   - Do not require excessive documentation

4. **Log the request**:
   - Date received
   - Request type
   - Requester identity
   - Applicable regulation
   - Response deadline
   - Assigned handler

### Response Timelines

| Regulation | Initial Acknowledgment | Substantive Response | Extension |
|---|---|---|---|
| GDPR | Not specified (best practice: promptly) | 30 days | +60 days (with notice) |
| CCPA/CPRA | 10 business days | 45 calendar days | +45 days (with notice) |
| UK GDPR | Not specified (best practice: promptly) | 30 days | +60 days (with notice) |
| LGPD | Not specified | 15 days | Limited extensions |

### Exemptions and Exceptions

Before fulfilling a request, check whether any exemptions apply:

**Common exemptions across regulations**:
- Legal claims defense or establishment
- Legal obligations requiring retention
- Public interest or official authority
- Freedom of expression and information (for erasure requests)
- Archiving in the public interest or scientific/historical research

**Organization-specific considerations**:
- Litigation hold: Data subject to a legal hold cannot be deleted
- Regulatory retention: Financial records, employment records, and other categories may have mandatory retention periods
- Third-party rights: Fulfilling the request might adversely affect the rights of others

### Response Process

1. Gather all personal data of the requester across systems
2. Apply any exemptions and document the basis
3. Prepare response: fulfill the request or explain why (in whole or part) it cannot be fulfilled
4. If denying (in whole or part): cite the specific legal basis for denial
5. Inform the requester of their right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority
6. Document the response and retain records of the request and response

## Regulatory Monitoring Basics

### What to Monitor

Maintain awareness of developments in:
- **Regulatory guidance**: New or updated guidance from supervisory authorities (ICO, CNIL, FTC, state AGs, etc.)
- **Enforcement actions**: Fines, orders, and settlements that signal regulatory priorities
- **Legislative changes**: New privacy laws, amendments to existing laws, implementing regulations
- **Industry standards**: Updates to ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST frameworks, and sector-specific requirements
- **Cross-border transfer developments**: Adequacy decisions, SCC updates, data localization requirements

### Monitoring Approach

1. **Subscribe to regulatory authority communications** (newsletters, RSS feeds, official announcements)
2. **Track relevant legal publications** for analysis of new developments
3. **Review industry association updates** for sector-specific guidance
4. **Maintain a regulatory calendar** of known upcoming deadlines, effective dates, and compliance milestones
5. **Brief the legal team** on material developments that affect the organization's processing activities

### Escalation Criteria

Escalate regulatory developments to senior counsel or leadership when:
- A new regulation or guidance directly affects the organization's core business activities
- An enforcement action in the organization's sector signals heightened regulatory scrutiny
- A compliance deadline is approaching that requires organizational changes
- A data transfer mechanism the organization relies on is challenged or invalidated
- A regulatory authority initiates an inquiry or investigation involving the organization

## Tips

1. **Be specific** — "We want to email all our users" is better than "marketing campaign."
2. **Include the geography** — Compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction.
3. **Mention the data** — What personal data is involved? This drives most compliance requirements.$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/legal/skills/legal-response', 'business', 'legal-response', '', 'legal-response', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# /legal-response -- Generate Response from Templates

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate a response to a common legal inquiry using configured templates. Customizes the response with specific details and includes escalation triggers for situations that should not use a templated response.

**Important**: This command assists with legal workflows but does not provide legal advice. Generated responses should be reviewed by qualified legal professionals before being sent, especially for regulated communications.

## Invocation

```
/legal-response [inquiry-type]
```

Common inquiry types:
- `dsr` or `data-subject-request` -- Data subject access/deletion/correction requests
- `hold` or `discovery-hold` -- Litigation hold notices
- `vendor` or `vendor-question` -- Vendor legal questions
- `nda` or `nda-request` -- NDA requests from business teams
- `privacy` or `privacy-inquiry` -- Privacy-related questions
- `subpoena` -- Subpoena or legal process responses
- `insurance` -- Insurance claim notifications
- `custom` -- Use a custom template

If no inquiry type is provided, ask the user what type of response they need and show available categories.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Inquiry Type

Accept the inquiry type from the user. If the type is ambiguous, show available categories and ask for clarification.

### Step 2: Load Template

Look for templates in local settings (e.g., `legal.local.md` or a templates directory).

**If templates are configured:**
- Load the appropriate template for the inquiry type
- Identify required variables (recipient name, dates, specific details)

**If no templates are configured:**
- Inform the user that no templates were found for this inquiry type
- Offer to help create a template (see Template Creation Guide below)
- Provide a reasonable default response structure based on the inquiry type

### Step 3: Check Escalation Triggers

Before generating any response, evaluate whether this situation has characteristics that should NOT use a templated response.

#### Universal Escalation Triggers (Apply to All Categories)
- The matter involves potential litigation or regulatory investigation
- The inquiry is from a regulator, government agency, or law enforcement
- The response could create a binding legal commitment or waiver
- The matter involves potential criminal liability
- Media attention is involved or likely
- The situation is unprecedented (no prior handling by the team)
- Multiple jurisdictions are involved with conflicting requirements
- The matter involves executive leadership or board members

#### Data Subject Request Escalation Triggers
- Request involves a minor's data, or is from/on behalf of a minor
- Request is from a regulatory authority (not an individual)
- Request involves data that is subject to a litigation hold
- Requester is a current or former employee with an active dispute or HR matter
- Request scope is unusually broad or appears to be a fishing expedition
- Request involves data processed in a jurisdiction with unique requirements
- Request involves special category data (health, biometric, genetic)

#### Discovery Hold Escalation Triggers
- The matter involves potential criminal liability
- The preservation scope is unclear, disputed, or potentially overbroad
- There are questions about whether certain data is within scope
- Prior holds for the same or related matter exist
- The hold may affect ongoing business operations significantly
- Hold conflicts with regulatory deletion requirements
- Custodian objects to the hold scope

#### Vendor Question Escalation Triggers
- The question involves a dispute or potential breach
- The vendor is threatening litigation or termination
- The question involves regulatory compliance (not just contract terms)
- The response could create a binding commitment or waiver
- Response could affect ongoing negotiation

#### NDA Request Escalation Triggers
- The counterparty is a competitor
- The NDA involves government classified information
- The business context suggests the NDA is for a potential M&A transaction
- The request involves unusual subject matter (AI training data, biometric data, etc.)

#### Subpoena / Legal Process Escalation Triggers
- **ALWAYS requires counsel review** (templates are starting points only)
- Privilege issues identified
- Third-party data involved
- Cross-border production issues
- Unreasonable timeline

**When an escalation trigger is detected:**
1. **Stop**: Do not generate a templated response
2. **Alert**: Inform the user that an escalation trigger has been detected
3. **Explain**: Describe which trigger was detected and why it matters
4. **Recommend**: Suggest the appropriate escalation path (senior counsel, outside counsel, specific team member)
5. **Offer**: Provide a draft for counsel review (clearly marked as "DRAFT - FOR COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY") rather than a final response

### Step 4: Gather Specific Details

Prompt the user for the details needed to customize the response:

**Data Subject Request:**
- Requester name and contact information
- Type of request (access, deletion, correction, portability, opt-out)
- What data is involved
- Applicable regulation (GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, other)
- Response deadline

**Discovery Hold:**
- Matter name and reference number
- Custodians (who needs to preserve)
- Scope of preservation (date range, data types, systems)
- Outside counsel contact
- Effective date

**Vendor Question:**
- Vendor name
- Reference agreement (if applicable)
- Specific question being addressed
- Relevant contract provisions

**NDA Request:**
- Requesting business team and contact
- Counterparty name
- Purpose of the NDA
- Mutual or unilateral
- Any special requirements

### Step 5: Generate Response

Populate the template with the gathered details. Ensure the response:
- Uses appropriate tone (professional, clear, not overly legalistic for business audiences)
- Includes all required legal elements for the response type
- References specific dates, deadlines, and obligations
- Provides clear next steps for the recipient
- Includes appropriate disclaimers or caveats

Present the draft response to the user for review before sending.

#### Customization Guidelines

**Required customization** — Every templated response MUST be customized with:
- Correct names, dates, and reference numbers
- Specific facts of the situation
- Applicable jurisdiction and regulation
- Correct response deadlines based on when the inquiry was received
- Appropriate signature block and contact information

**Tone adjustment** — Adjust tone based on:
- **Audience**: Internal vs. external, business vs. legal, individual vs. regulatory authority
- **Relationship**: New counterparty vs. existing partner vs. adversarial party
- **Sensitivity**: Routine inquiry vs. contentious matter vs. regulatory investigation
- **Urgency**: Standard timeline vs. expedited response needed

**Jurisdiction-specific adjustments:**
- Verify that cited regulations are correct for the requester's jurisdiction
- Adjust timelines to match applicable law
- Include jurisdiction-specific rights information
- Use jurisdiction-appropriate legal terminology

### Step 6: Template Creation (If No Template Exists)

If the user wants to create a new template, walk through the Template Creation Guide (see below) and present the finished template for review. Suggest the user save the approved template to their local settings for future use.

## Template Management Methodology

### Template Organization

Templates should be organized by category and maintained in the team's local settings. Each template should include:

1. **Category**: The type of inquiry the template addresses
2. **Template name**: A descriptive identifier
3. **Use case**: When this template is appropriate
4. **Escalation triggers**: When this template should NOT be used
5. **Required variables**: Information that must be customized for each use
6. **Template body**: The response text with variable placeholders
7. **Follow-up actions**: Standard steps after sending the response
8. **Last reviewed date**: When the template was last verified for accuracy

### Template Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Draft template based on best practices and team input
2. **Review**: Legal team review and approval of template content
3. **Publication**: Add to template library with metadata
4. **Use**: Generate responses using the template
5. **Feedback**: Track when templates are modified during use to identify improvement opportunities
6. **Update**: Revise templates when laws, policies, or best practices change
7. **Retirement**: Archive templates that are no longer applicable

## Template Creation Guide

When helping users create new templates:

### 1. Define the Use Case
- What type of inquiry does this address?
- How frequently does this come up?
- Who is the typical audience?
- What is the typical urgency level?

### 2. Identify Required Elements
- What information must be included in every response?
- What regulatory requirements apply?
- What organizational policies govern this type of response?

### 3. Define Variables
- What changes with each use? (names, dates, specifics)
- What stays the same? (legal requirements, standard language)
- Use clear variable names: `{{requester_name}}`, `{{response_deadline}}`, `{{matter_reference}}`

### 4. Draft the Template
- Write in clear, professional language
- Avoid unnecessary legal jargon for business audiences
- Include all legally required elements
- Add placeholders for all variable content
- Include a subject line template if for email use

### 5. Define Escalation Triggers
- What situations should NOT use this template?
- What characteristics indicate the matter needs individualized attention?
- Be specific: vague triggers are not useful

### 6. Add Metadata
- Template name and category
- Version number and last reviewed date
- Author and approver
- Follow-up actions checklist

### Template Format

```markdown

## Notes

- Always present the draft response for user review before suggesting it be sent
- If connected to email via MCP, offer to create a draft email with the response
- Track response deadlines and offer to set calendar reminders
- For regulated responses (DSRs, subpoenas), always note the applicable deadline and regulatory requirements
- Templates should be living documents; suggest updates when the user modifies a templated response, so the template can be improved over time$body$)
ON CONFLICT (skill_key) DO NOTHING;

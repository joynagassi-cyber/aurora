## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing runbooks to update rather than create from scratch
- Publish the completed runbook to your ops wiki

If **~~ITSM** is connected:
- Link the runbook to related incident types and change requests
- Auto-populate escalation contacts from on-call schedules

## Tips

1. **Be painfully specific** — "Run the script" is not a step. "Run `python sync.py --prod --dry-run` from the ops server" is.
2. **Include failure modes** — What can go wrong at each step and what to do about it.
3. **Test the runbook** — Have someone unfamiliar with the process follow it. Fix where they get stuck.$body$),

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing vendor evaluations, contracts, and performance reviews
- Pull procurement policies and approval thresholds

If **~~procurement** is connected:
- Pull current contract terms, spend history, and renewal dates
- Compare pricing against existing vendor agreements

## Tips

1. **Upload the proposal** — I can extract pricing, terms, and SLAs from vendor documents.
2. **Compare vendors** — "Compare Vendor A vs Vendor B" gets you a side-by-side analysis.
3. **Include current spend** — For renewals, knowing what you pay now helps evaluate price changes.$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/apollo/skills/enrich-lead', 'business', 'enrich-lead', '', 'enrich-lead', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Enrich Lead

Turn any identifier into a full contact dossier. The user provides identifying info via "$ARGUMENTS".

## Examples

- `/apollo:enrich-lead Tim Zheng at Apollo`
- `/apollo:enrich-lead https://www.linkedin.com/in/timzheng`
- `/apollo:enrich-lead sarah@stripe.com`
- `/apollo:enrich-lead Jane Smith, VP Engineering, Notion`
- `/apollo:enrich-lead CEO of Figma`

## Step 1 — Parse Input

From "$ARGUMENTS", extract every identifier available:
- First name, last name
- Company name or domain
- LinkedIn URL
- Email address
- Job title (use as a matching hint)

If the input is ambiguous (e.g. just "CEO of Figma"), first use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_people_api_search` with relevant title and domain filters to identify the person, then proceed to enrichment.

## Step 2 — Enrich the Person

> **Credit warning**: Tell the user enrichment consumes 1 Apollo credit before calling.

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_people_match` with all available identifiers:
- `first_name`, `last_name` if name is known
- `domain` or `organization_name` if company is known
- `linkedin_url` if LinkedIn is provided
- `email` if email is provided
- Set `reveal_personal_emails` to `true`

If the match fails, try `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_people_api_search` with looser filters and present the top 3 candidates. Ask the user to pick one, then re-enrich.

## Step 3 — Enrich Their Company

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_organizations_enrich` with the person's company domain to pull firmographic context.

## Step 4 — Present the Contact Card

Format the output exactly like this:

---

**[Full Name]** | [Title]
[Company Name] · [Industry] · [Employee Count] employees

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Email (work) | ... |
| Email (personal) | ... (if revealed) |
| Phone (direct) | ... |
| Phone (mobile) | ... |
| Phone (corporate) | ... |
| Location | City, State, Country |
| LinkedIn | URL |
| Company Domain | ... |
| Company Revenue | Range |
| Company Funding | Total raised |
| Company HQ | Location |

---

## Step 5 — Offer Next Actions

Ask the user which action to take:

1. **Save to Apollo** — Create this person as a contact via `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_contacts_create` with `run_dedupe: true`
2. **Add to a sequence** — Ask which sequence, then run the sequence-load flow
3. **Find colleagues** — Search for more people at the same company using `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_people_api_search` with `q_organization_domains_list` set to this company
4. **Find similar people** — Search for people with the same title/seniority at other companies$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/apollo/skills/prospect', 'business', 'prospect', '', 'prospect', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Prospect

Go from an ICP description to a ranked, enriched lead list in one shot. The user describes their ideal customer via "$ARGUMENTS".

## Examples

- `/apollo:prospect VP of Engineering at Series B+ SaaS companies in the US, 200-1000 employees`
- `/apollo:prospect heads of marketing at e-commerce companies in Europe`
- `/apollo:prospect CTOs at fintech startups, 50-500 employees, New York`
- `/apollo:prospect procurement managers at manufacturing companies with 1000+ employees`
- `/apollo:prospect SDR leaders at companies using Salesforce and Outreach`

## Step 1 — Parse the ICP

Extract structured filters from the natural language description in "$ARGUMENTS":

**Company filters:**
- Industry/vertical keywords → `q_organization_keyword_tags`
- Employee count ranges → `organization_num_employees_ranges`
- Company locations → `organization_locations`
- Specific domains → `q_organization_domains_list`

**Person filters:**
- Job titles → `person_titles`
- Seniority levels → `person_seniorities`
- Person locations → `person_locations`

If the ICP is vague, ask 1-2 clarifying questions before proceeding. At minimum, you need a title/role and an industry or company size.

## Step 2 — Search for Companies

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_companies_search` with the company filters:
- `q_organization_keyword_tags` for industry/vertical
- `organization_num_employees_ranges` for size
- `organization_locations` for geography
- Set `per_page` to 25

## Step 3 — Enrich Top Companies

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_organizations_bulk_enrich` with the domains from the top 10 results. This reveals revenue, funding, headcount, and firmographic data to help rank companies.

## Step 4 — Find Decision Makers

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_people_api_search` with:
- `person_titles` and `person_seniorities` from the ICP
- `q_organization_domains_list` scoped to the enriched company domains
- `per_page` set to 25

## Step 5 — Enrich Top Leads

> **Credit warning**: Tell the user exactly how many credits will be consumed before proceeding.

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_people_bulk_match` to enrich up to 10 leads per call with:
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `domain` for each person
- `reveal_personal_emails` set to `true`

If more than 10 leads, batch into multiple calls.

## Step 6 — Present the Lead Table

Show results in a ranked table:

### Leads matching: [ICP Summary]

| # | Name | Title | Company | Employees | Revenue | Email | Phone | ICP Fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**ICP Fit** scoring:
- **Strong** — title, seniority, company size, and industry all match
- **Good** — 3 of 4 criteria match
- **Partial** — 2 of 4 criteria match

**Summary**: Found X leads across Y companies. Z credits consumed.

## Step 7 — Offer Next Actions

Ask the user:

1. **Save all to Apollo** — Bulk-create contacts via `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_contacts_create` with `run_dedupe: true` for each lead
2. **Load into a sequence** — Ask which sequence and run the sequence-load flow for these contacts
3. **Deep-dive a company** — Run `/apollo:company-intel` on any company from the list
4. **Refine the search** — Adjust filters and re-run
5. **Export** — Format leads as a CSV-style table for easy copy-paste$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/apollo/skills/sequence-load', 'business', 'sequence-load', '', 'sequence-load', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Sequence Load

Find, enrich, and load contacts into an outreach sequence — end to end. The user provides targeting criteria and a sequence name via "$ARGUMENTS".

## Examples

- `/apollo:sequence-load add 20 VP Sales at SaaS companies to my "Q1 Outbound" sequence`
- `/apollo:sequence-load SDR managers at fintech startups → Cold Outreach v2`
- `/apollo:sequence-load list sequences` (shows all available sequences)
- `/apollo:sequence-load directors of engineering, 500+ employees, US → Demo Follow-up`
- `/apollo:sequence-load reload 15 more leads into "Enterprise Pipeline"`

## Step 1 — Parse Input

From "$ARGUMENTS", extract:

**Targeting criteria:**
- Job titles → `person_titles`
- Seniority levels → `person_seniorities`
- Industry keywords → `q_organization_keyword_tags`
- Company size → `organization_num_employees_ranges`
- Locations → `person_locations` or `organization_locations`

**Sequence info:**
- Sequence name (text after "to", "into", or "→")
- Volume — how many contacts to add (default: 10 if not specified)

If the user just says "list sequences", skip to Step 2 and show all available sequences.

## Step 2 — Find the Sequence

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_emailer_campaigns_search` to find the target sequence:
- Set `q_name` to the sequence name from input

If no match or multiple matches:
- Show all available sequences in a table: | Name | ID | Status |
- Ask the user to pick one

## Step 3 — Get Email Account

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_email_accounts_index` to list linked email accounts.

- If one account → use automatically
- If multiple → show them and ask which to send from

## Step 4 — Find Matching People

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_mixed_people_api_search` with the targeting criteria.
- Set `per_page` to the requested volume (or 10 by default)

Present the candidates in a preview table:

| # | Name | Title | Company | Location |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Ask: **"Add these [N] contacts to [Sequence Name]? This will consume [N] Apollo credits for enrichment."**

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 5 — Enrich and Create Contacts

For each approved lead:

1. **Enrich** — Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_people_bulk_match` (batch up to 10 per call) with:
   - `first_name`, `last_name`, `domain` for each person
   - `reveal_personal_emails` set to `true`

2. **Create contacts** — For each enriched person, use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_contacts_create` with:
   - `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `title`, `organization_name`
   - `direct_phone` or `mobile_phone` if available
   - `run_dedupe` set to `true`

Collect all created contact IDs.

## Step 6 — Add to Sequence

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_emailer_campaigns_add_contact_ids` with:
- `id`: the sequence ID
- `emailer_campaign_id`: same sequence ID
- `contact_ids`: array of created contact IDs
- `send_email_from_email_account_id`: the chosen email account ID
- `sequence_active_in_other_campaigns`: `false` (safe default)

## Step 7 — Confirm Enrollment

Show a summary:

---

**Sequence loaded successfully**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Sequence | [Name] |
| Contacts added | [count] |
| Sending from | [email address] |
| Credits used | [count] |

**Contacts enrolled:**

| Name | Title | Company | Email |
|---|---|---|---|

---

## Step 8 — Offer Next Actions

Ask the user:

1. **Load more** — Find and add another batch of leads
2. **Review sequence** — Show sequence details and all enrolled contacts
3. **Remove a contact** — Use `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_MCP__apollo_emailer_campaigns_remove_or_stop_contact_ids` to remove specific contacts
4. **Pause a contact** — Re-add with `status: "paused"` and an `auto_unpause_at` date$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/brand-voice/skills/brand-voice-enforcement', 'business', 'brand-voice-enforcement', '', 'brand-voice-enforcement', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Brand Voice Enforcement

Apply existing brand guidelines to all sales and marketing content generation. Load the user's brand guidelines, apply voice constants and tone flexes to the content request, validate output, and explain brand choices.

## Loading Brand Guidelines

Find the user's brand guidelines using this sequence. Stop as soon as you find them:

1. **Session context** — Check if brand guidelines were generated earlier in this session (via `/brand-voice:generate-guidelines`). If so, they are already in the conversation. Use them directly. Session-generated guidelines are the freshest and reflect the user's most recent intent.

2. **Local guidelines file** — Check for `.claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md` inside the user's working folder. Do NOT use a relative path from the agent's current working directory — in Cowork, the agent runs from a plugin cache directory, not the user's project. Resolve the path relative to the user's working folder. If no working folder is set, skip this step.

3. **Ask the user** — If none of the above found guidelines, tell the user:
   "I couldn't find your brand guidelines. You can:
   - Run `/brand-voice:discover-brand` to find brand materials across your platforms
   - Run `/brand-voice:generate-guidelines` to create guidelines from documents or transcripts
   - Paste guidelines directly into this chat or point me to a file"

   Wait for the user to provide guidelines before proceeding.

Also read `.claude/brand-voice.local.md` for enforcement settings (even if guidelines came from another source):
- `strictness`: strict | balanced | flexible
- `always-explain`: whether to always explain brand choices

## Enforcement Workflow

### 1. Analyze the Content Request

Before writing, identify:
- **Content type**: email, presentation, proposal, social post, message, etc.
- **Target audience**: role, seniority, industry, company stage
- **Key messages needed**: which message pillars apply
- **Specific requirements**: length, format, tone overrides

### 2. Apply Voice Constants

Voice is the brand's personality — it stays constant across all content:
- Apply "We Are / We Are Not" attributes from guidelines
- Use brand personality consistently
- Incorporate approved terminology; reject prohibited terms
- Follow messaging framework and value propositions

Refer to `references/voice-constant-tone-flexes.md` for the "voice constant, tone flexes" model.

### 3. Flex Tone for Context

Tone adapts by content type and audience. Use the tone-by-context matrix from guidelines to set:
- **Formality**: How formal or casual should this be?
- **Energy**: How much urgency or enthusiasm?
- **Technical depth**: How detailed or accessible?

### 4. Generate Content

Create content that:
- Matches brand voice attributes throughout
- Follows tone guidelines for this specific content type
- Incorporates key messages naturally (not forced)
- Uses preferred terminology
- Mirrors the quality and style of guideline examples

For complex or long-form content, delegate to the content-generation agent (defined in `agents/content-generation.md`).
For high-stakes content, delegate to the quality-assurance agent (defined in `agents/quality-assurance.md`) for validation.

### 5. Validate and Explain

After generating content:
- Briefly highlight which brand guidelines were applied
- Explain key voice and tone decisions
- Note any areas where guidelines were adapted for context
- Offer to refine based on feedback

When `always-explain` is true in settings, include brand application notes with every response.

## Handling Conflicts

When the user's request conflicts with brand guidelines:
1. Explain the conflict clearly
2. Provide a recommendation
3. Offer options: follow guidelines strictly, adapt for context, or override

Default to adapting guidelines with an explanation of the tradeoff.

## Open Questions Awareness

Open questions are unresolved brand positioning decisions flagged during guideline generation, stored in the guidelines under an "Open Questions" section. When generating content, check if the brand guidelines contain open questions:
- If content touches an unresolved open question, note it
- Apply the agent's recommendation from the open question unless the user specifies otherwise
- Suggest resolving the question if it significantly impacts the content

## Reference Files

- **`references/voice-constant-tone-flexes.md`** — The "voice constant, tone flexes" mental model, "We Are / We Are Not" table structure, and tone-by-context matrix explanation
- **`references/before-after-examples.md`** — Before/after content examples per content type showing enforcement in practice$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/brand-voice/skills/discover-brand', 'business', 'discover-brand', '', 'discover-brand', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Brand Discovery

Orchestrate autonomous discovery of brand materials across enterprise platforms. This skill coordinates the discover-brand agent to search connected platforms (Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Box, Microsoft 365, Figma, Gong, Granola, Slack), triage sources, and produce a structured discovery report with open questions.

## Discovery Workflow

### 0. Orient the User

Before starting, briefly explain what's about to happen so the user knows what to expect:

"Here's how brand discovery works:

1. **Search** — I'll search your connected platforms (Notion, Google Drive, Slack, etc.) for brand-related materials: style guides, pitch decks, templates, transcripts, and more.
2. **Analyze** — I'll categorize and rank what I find, pull the best sources, and produce a discovery report with what I found, any conflicts, and open questions.
3. **Generate guidelines** — Once you've reviewed the report, I can generate a structured brand voice guideline document from the results.
4. **Save** — Guidelines are saved to `.claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md` in your working folder once you approve them. Nothing is written until that step.

The search usually takes a few minutes depending on how many platforms are connected. Ready to get started?"

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding. If they have questions about the process, answer them first.

### 1. Check Settings

Read `.claude/brand-voice.local.md` if it exists. Extract:
- Company name
- Which platforms are enabled (notion, confluence, google-drive, box, microsoft-365, figma, gong, granola, slack)
- Search depth preference (standard or deep)
- Max sources limit
- Any known brand material locations listed under "Known Brand Materials"

If no settings file exists, proceed with all connected platforms and standard search depth.

### 2. Validate Platform Coverage

Before confirming scope, check which platforms are actually connected and classify them:

**Document platforms** (where brand guidelines, style guides, templates, and decks live):
- Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Box, Microsoft 365 (SharePoint/OneDrive)

**Supplementary platforms** (valuable for patterns, but not where brand docs are stored):
- Slack, Gong, Granola, Figma

Apply these rules:

1. **If zero document platforms are connected**: **Stop.** Tell the user: "You don't have any document storage platforms connected (Google Drive, SharePoint, Notion, Confluence, or Box). Brand guidelines and style guides almost always live on one of these. Please connect at least one before running discovery. Gong/Granola/Slack transcripts are valuable supplements but unlikely to contain formal brand documents."

2. **If no Google Drive AND no Microsoft 365 AND no Box**: **Warn** (but proceed): "None of your primary file storage platforms (Google Drive, SharePoint, Box) are connected. Brand documents frequently live on these platforms. Discovery will proceed with [connected platforms], but results may have significant gaps. Consider connecting Google Drive or SharePoint."

3. **If only one platform total is connected**: **Warn** (but proceed): "Only [platform] is connected. Discovery works best with 2+ platforms for cross-source validation. Results from a single platform will have lower confidence scores."

### 3. Confirm Scope with User

Before launching discovery, confirm:
- Which platforms to search (default: all connected)
- Whether to include conversation transcripts (Gong, Granola) or just documents
- Any known locations to prioritize

Keep this brief — one question, not a questionnaire.

### 4. Delegate to Discover-Brand Agent

Launch the discover-brand agent via the Task tool. Provide:
- Company name (from settings or user input)
- Enabled platforms
- Search depth
- Any known URLs or locations to check first

The agent executes the 4-phase discovery algorithm autonomously:
1. **Broad Discovery** — parallel searches across platforms
2. **Source Triage** — categorize and rank sources
3. **Deep Fetch** — retrieve and extract from top sources
4. **Discovery Report** — structured output with open questions

### 5. Present Discovery Report

When the agent returns, present the report to the user with a summary:
- Total sources found and analyzed
- Key brand elements discovered
- Any conflicts between sources
- Open questions requiring team input

### 6. Offer Next Steps

After presenting the report, offer:
1. **Generate guidelines now** — chain to `/brand-voice:generate-guidelines` using discovery report as input
2. **Resolve open questions first** — work through high-priority questions before generating
3. **Save report** — store the discovery report to Notion or as a local file
4. **Expand search** — search additional platforms or deeper if coverage is low

## Open Questions

Open questions arise when the discovery agent encounters ambiguity it cannot resolve:
- Conflicting documents (e.g., 2023 style guide vs. 2024 brand update)
- Missing critical sections (e.g., no social media guidelines found)
- Inconsistent terminology across platforms

Every open question includes an agent recommendation. Present questions as "confirm or override" — not dead ends.

## Integration with Other Skills

- **Guideline Generation**: The discovery report is returned by the discover-brand agent via the Task tool. Pass it directly to the guideline-generation skill as structured input, replacing the need for users to manually gather sources.
- **Brand Voice Enforcement**: Once guidelines are generated from discovery, enforcement uses them automatically.

## Error Handling

- If zero platforms are connected, inform the user which platforms the plugin supports and how to connect them.
- If all searches return empty results, flag the discovery as "low coverage" and suggest the user provide documents manually or check platform connections.
- If a platform is connected but returns permission errors, note the gap and continue with other platforms.

## Reference Files

For detailed discovery patterns and algorithms, consult:

- **`references/search-strategies.md`** — Platform-specific search queries, query patterns by platform, and tips for maximizing discovery coverage
- **`references/source-ranking.md`** — Source category definitions, ranking algorithm weights, and triage decision criteria$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/brand-voice/skills/guideline-generation', 'business', 'guideline-generation', '', 'guideline-generation', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# Guideline Generation

Generate comprehensive, LLM-ready brand voice guidelines from any combination of sources — brand documents, sales call transcripts, discovery reports, or direct user input. Transform raw materials into structured, enforceable guidelines with confidence scoring and open questions.

## Inputs

Accept any combination of:
- **Discovery report** from the discover-brand skill (structured, pre-triaged)
- **Brand documents** uploaded or from connected platforms (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, MD, TXT)
- **Conversation transcripts** from Gong, Granola, manual uploads, or Notion meeting notes
- **Direct user input** about their brand voice and values

When a discovery report is provided, use it as the primary input — sources are already triaged and ranked. Supplement with additional analysis as needed.

## Generation Workflow

### 1. Identify and Classify Sources

Determine what the user has provided. If no sources are available:
- Check if a discovery report exists from a previous `/brand-voice:discover-brand` run
- Check `.claude/brand-voice.local.md` for known brand material locations
- Suggest running discovery first: `/brand-voice:discover-brand`

### 2. Process Sources

**For documents:** Delegate to the document-analysis agent for heavy parsing. Extract voice attributes, messaging themes, terminology, tone guidance, and examples.

**For transcripts:** Delegate to the conversation-analysis agent for pattern recognition. Extract implicit voice attributes, successful language patterns, tone by context, and anti-patterns.

**For discovery reports:** Extract pre-triaged sources, conflicts, and gaps. Use the ranked sources directly.

### 3. Synthesize Into Guidelines

Merge all findings into a unified guideline document following the template in `references/guideline-template.md`. Key sections:

**"We Are / We Are Not" Table** — The core brand identity anchor:

| We Are | We Are Not |
|--------|------------|
| [Attribute — e.g., "Confident"] | [Counter — e.g., "Arrogant"] |
| [Attribute — e.g., "Approachable"] | [Counter — e.g., "Casual or sloppy"] |

Derive attributes from the most consistent patterns across sources. Each row should have supporting evidence.

**Voice Constants vs. Tone Flexes** — Clarify what stays fixed and what adapts:
- **Voice** = personality, values, "We Are / We Are Not" — constant across all content
- **Tone** = formality, energy, technical depth — flexes by context

**Tone-by-Context Matrix:**

| Context | Formality | Energy | Technical Depth | Example |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Cold outreach | Medium | High | Low | "[example phrase]" |
| Enterprise proposal | High | Medium | High | "[example phrase]" |
| Social media | Low | High | Low | "[example phrase]" |

### 4. Assign Confidence Scores

Score each section using the methodology in `references/confidence-scoring.md`:
- **High confidence**: 3+ corroborating sources, explicit guidance found
- **Medium confidence**: 1-2 sources, or inferred from patterns
- **Low confidence**: Single source, inferred, or conflicting data

### 5. Surface Open Questions

Generate open questions for any ambiguity that cannot be resolved:

```markdown
## Open Questions for Team Discussion

### High Priority (blocks guideline completion)
1. **[Question Title]**
   - What was found: [conflicting or incomplete info]
   - Agent recommendation: [suggested resolution with reasoning]
   - Need from you: [specific decision or confirmation needed]
```

Every open question MUST include an agent recommendation. Turn ambiguity into "confirm or override" — never a dead end.

### 6. Quality Check

Before presenting, verify via the quality-assurance agent (defined in `agents/quality-assurance.md`):
- All major sections populated (including Brand Personality and Content Examples if sources support them)
- At least 3 voice attributes with evidence
- "We Are / We Are Not" table has 4+ rows
- Tone matrix covers at least 3 contexts
- Confidence scores assigned per section
- Source attribution for all extracted elements
- No PII exposed
- Open questions include recommendations

### 7. Present and Offer Next Steps

Summarize key findings:
- Total sections generated with confidence breakdown
- Strongest voice attribute and most effective message
- Number of open questions (if any)

### 8. Save for Future Sessions

The default save location is `.claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md` inside the user's working folder.

**Important:** The agent's working directory may not be the user's project root (especially in Cowork, where plugins run from a plugin cache directory). Always resolve the path relative to the user's working folder, not the current working directory. If no working folder is set, skip the file save and tell the user guidelines will only be available in this conversation.

1. **Resolve the save path.** The file MUST be saved to `.claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md` inside the user's working folder. Confirm the working folder path before writing.
2. **Check if guidelines already exist** at that path
3. **If they exist, archive the previous version:** Rename the existing file to `brand-voice-guidelines-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the same directory (using today's date)
4. **Save new guidelines** to `.claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md` inside the working folder
5. **Confirm to the user** with the full absolute path: "Guidelines saved to `<full-path>`. `/brand-voice:enforce-voice` will find them automatically in future sessions."

The guidelines are also present in this conversation, so `/brand-voice:enforce-voice` can use them immediately without loading from file.

After saving, offer:
1. Walk through the guidelines section by section
2. Start creating content with `/brand-voice:enforce-voice`
3. Resolve open questions

## Privacy and Security

Enforce these privacy constraints throughout the entire generation workflow, not only at output time:
- Redact customer names and contact information from all examples
- Anonymize company names in transcript excerpts if requested
- Flag any sensitive information detected during processing

Retrieve and synthesize account information from Common Room. Handles four interaction patterns: full overviews, targeted field questions, sparse data situations, and combined MCP data + LLM reasoning.

## Step 0: Load User Context (Me)

Before researching any account, fetch the `Me` object from Common Room. This provides:
- The user's profile, title, role, and Persona in CR
- The user's segments ("My Segments")

Default all queries to the user's own segments unless the user explicitly asks for a broader view. This keeps results scoped to their territory.

## Step 1: Identify the Interaction Pattern

Determine what the user actually needs before deciding how much data to fetch:

**Pattern 1 — Full Overview:** "Tell me about Datadog" / "Summarize cloudflare.com"
→ Fetch the full field set and produce a structured briefing.

**Pattern 2 — Targeted Question:** "Who owns the Snowflake account?" / "Is acme.io showing buying signals?" / "What's the employee count for notion.so?"
→ Fetch only the relevant field(s). Return a direct, concise answer — do not produce a full brief for a simple question.

**Pattern 3 — Sparse Data:** "Tell me about tiny-startup.io"
→ If Common Room has limited data for an account, say so honestly: "There is limited information available for this account." Never speculate or fill gaps with generic statements.

**Pattern 4 — Combined Reasoning:** Fetch structured MCP data, then layer in LLM analysis — e.g., "Stripe has 8,000 employees and is hiring heavily for AI roles. Based on your ICP of 1k–10k fintech companies, this is a strong fit."

## Step 2: Look Up the Account

Search Common Room for the account by domain or company name. Exact match first; if no result, try partial match and confirm with the user before proceeding.

## Step 3: Fetch the Right Fields

Use the Common Room object catalog to see available field groups and their contents. For full overviews, request all field groups. For targeted questions, request only what's relevant.

**Key field groups to know about:**
- **Scores** — always return as raw values or percentiles, never labels
- **Summary research** — RoomieAI output; often the richest qualitative signal
- **Top contacts** — sorted by score desc; use communityMemberID for full lookups

**Choosing what to fetch:**

| User query type | Fields to request |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Full account overview | All field groups |
| "Who owns this account?" | Company profiles & links, CRM fields |
| "Is this company a good fit?" | Key fields, scores, about |
| "What signals is this account showing?" | Scores, summary research, CRM fields |
| "Who are the top contacts?" | Top contacts |
| "What does RoomieAI say about them?" | Summary research, all research |
| "Find engineers at this account" | Prospects (with title filter) |

## Step 4: Web Search (Sparse Data Only)

Common Room is the primary data source. Do not run web search when CR returns rich data.

When CR data is sparse (Pattern 3 — few fields returned, no activity, no scores), run a targeted web search to fill gaps:
- `"[company name]" news` — scoped to the last 30 days
- Look for: funding rounds, acquisitions, product launches, executive changes, press coverage

If the user explicitly asks for external context or recent news, run web search regardless of data richness.

## Step 5: Apply Reasoning (Pattern 4)

When the user's question invites synthesis — not just data retrieval — layer in analysis:
- Compare account data to known ICP criteria from session context
- Identify fit signals (size, industry, tech stack, hiring patterns)
- Note timing signals (funding, trial status, recent activity spike)
- Frame insights as clearly derived from data, not assumed

When the user's company context is available (see `references/my-company-context.md`), position findings relative to the user's value proposition and ICP.

## Step 6: Produce Output

Only include sections where Common Room returned actual data. Omit sections entirely rather than filling them with guesses.

**Full overview (when data is rich):**

```
## [Company Name] — Account Overview

**Snapshot**
[2–3 sentences: what they do, plan/stage, relationship status]

**Key Details**
[Employee count, industry, location, domain, funding — from key fields]

**CRM & Ownership** [If CRM fields returned]
[Owner, opp stage, ARR]

**Scores** [If scores returned]
[All available scores as raw values or percentiles]

**Signal Highlights** [If activity/signals exist]
[3–5 most important signals with dates]

**Top Contacts** [If contacts returned]
[Name | Title | Score — top 5 sorted by score desc]

**RoomieAI Research** [If summary research is non-null]
[Summary research output; list all available research topic names]

**Recommended Next Steps**
[2–3 specific, signal-backed actions]
```

**Targeted question:** 1–3 sentence direct answer. No full brief needed.

**Sparse data (few fields returned, most sections would be empty):**

```
## [Company Name] — Account Overview (Limited Data)

**Data available:** [List exactly what Common Room returned]

[Present only the returned fields]

**Web Search**
[Findings from web search — or "No significant recent news found"]

**Note:** Common Room has limited data on this account. The account may need enrichment in Common Room.
```

## Quality Standards

- Scores must always be raw values or percentiles — never categorical labels
- For targeted questions, answer precisely and don't over-deliver
- Be explicit when data is missing or stale — don't speculate
- Keep full briefings readable in 2–3 minutes
- **Every fact must trace to a tool call** — don't include data not returned by Common Room

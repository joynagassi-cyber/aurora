Generate comprehensive developer handoff documentation from a design.

## Usage

```
/design-handoff $ARGUMENTS
```

Generate handoff specs for: @$1

If a Figma URL is provided, pull the design from Figma. Otherwise, work from the provided description or screenshot.

## What to Include

### Visual Specifications
- Exact measurements (padding, margins, widths)
- Design token references (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Component variants and states

### Interaction Specifications
- Click/tap behavior
- Hover states
- Transitions and animations (duration, easing)
- Gesture support (swipe, pinch, long-press)

### Content Specifications
- Character limits
- Truncation behavior
- Empty states
- Loading states
- Error states

### Edge Cases
- Minimum/maximum content
- International text (longer strings)
- Slow connections
- Missing data

### Accessibility
- Focus order
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard interactions
- Screen reader announcements

## Principles

1. **Don't assume** — If it's not specified, the developer will guess. Specify everything.
2. **Use tokens, not values** — Reference `spacing-md` not `16px`.
3. **Show all states** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty.
4. **Describe the why** — "This collapses on mobile because users primarily use one-handed" helps developers make good judgment calls.

## Output

```markdown

```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Pull exact measurements, tokens, and component specs from Figma
- Export assets and generate a complete spec sheet

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link the handoff to the implementation ticket
- Create sub-tasks for each section of the spec

## Tips

1. **Share the Figma link** — I can pull exact measurements, tokens, and component info.
2. **Mention edge cases** — "What happens with 100 items?" helps me spec boundary conditions.
3. **Specify the tech stack** — "We use React + Tailwind" helps me give relevant implementation notes.$body$),

Manage your design system — audit for consistency, document components, or design new patterns.

## Usage

```
/design-system audit                    # Full system audit
/design-system document [component]     # Document a component
/design-system extend [pattern]         # Design a new component or pattern
```

## Components of a Design System

### Design Tokens
Atomic values that define the visual language:
- Colors (brand, semantic, neutral)
- Typography (scale, weights, line heights)
- Spacing (scale, component padding)
- Borders (radius, width)
- Shadows (elevation levels)
- Motion (durations, easings)

### Components
Reusable UI elements with defined:
- Variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Behavior (interactions, animations)
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard)

### Patterns
Common UI solutions combining components:
- Forms (input groups, validation, submission)
- Navigation (sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
- Data display (tables, cards, lists)
- Feedback (toasts, modals, inline messages)

## Principles

1. **Consistency over creativity** — The system exists so teams don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Flexibility within constraints** — Components should be composable, not rigid
3. **Document everything** — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
4. **Version and migrate** — Breaking changes need migration paths

## Output — Audit

```markdown

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Audit components directly in Figma — check naming, variants, and token usage
- Pull component properties and layer structure for documentation

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing component documentation and usage guidelines
- Publish updated documentation to your wiki

## Tips

1. **Start with an audit** — Know where you are before deciding where to go.
2. **Document as you build** — It's easier to document a component while designing it.
3. **Prioritize coverage over perfection** — 80% of components documented beats 100% of 10 components.$body$),

Synthesize user research data into actionable insights. See the **user-research** skill for research methods, interview guides, and analysis frameworks.

## Usage

```
/research-synthesis $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Accept

- Interview transcripts or notes
- Survey results (CSV, pasted data)
- Usability test recordings or notes
- Support tickets or feedback
- NPS/CSAT responses
- App store reviews

### Methodology Notes
[How the research was conducted, any limitations or biases to note]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Pull support tickets, feature requests, and NPS responses to supplement research data
- Cross-reference themes with real user complaints and requests

If **~~product analytics** is connected:
- Validate qualitative findings with usage data and behavioral metrics
- Quantify the impact of identified pain points

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior research studies and findings to compare against
- Publish the synthesis to your research repository

## Tips

1. **Include raw quotes** — Direct participant quotes make insights credible and memorable.
2. **Separate observations from interpretations** — "5 of 8 users clicked the wrong button" is an observation. "The button placement is confusing" is an interpretation.
3. **Quantify where possible** — "Most users" is vague. "7 of 10 users" is specific.$body$),

- Synthesis report (themes, insights, recommendations)
- Highlight reel (key quotes and observations)$body$),
('marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins/knowledge-work-plugins/design/skills/ux-copy', 'business', 'ux-copy', '', 'ux-copy', '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, 'marketplace:knowledge-work-plugins', '', $body$# /ux-copy

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Write or review UX copy for any interface context.

## Usage

```
/ux-copy $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Need From You

- **Context**: What screen, flow, or feature?
- **User state**: What is the user trying to do? How are they feeling?
- **Tone**: Formal, friendly, playful, reassuring?
- **Constraints**: Character limits, platform guidelines?

## Principles

1. **Clear**: Say exactly what you mean. No jargon, no ambiguity.
2. **Concise**: Use the fewest words that convey the full meaning.
3. **Consistent**: Same terms for the same things everywhere.
4. **Useful**: Every word should help the user accomplish their goal.
5. **Human**: Write like a helpful person, not a robot.

## Copy Patterns

### CTAs
- Start with a verb: "Start free trial", "Save changes", "Download report"
- Be specific: "Create account" not "Submit"
- Match the outcome to the label

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened + Why + How to fix
- "Payment declined. Your card was declined by your bank. Try a different card or contact your bank."

### Empty States
Structure: What this is + Why it's empty + How to start
- "No projects yet. Create your first project to start collaborating with your team."

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Make the action clear: "Delete 3 files?" not "Are you sure?"
- Describe consequences: "This can't be undone"
- Label buttons with the action: "Delete files" / "Keep files" not "OK" / "Cancel"

### Tooltips
- Concise, helpful, never obvious

### Loading States
- Set expectations, reduce anxiety

### Onboarding
- Progressive disclosure, one concept at a time

## Voice and Tone

Adapt tone to context:
- **Success**: Celebratory but not over the top
- **Error**: Empathetic and helpful
- **Warning**: Clear and actionable
- **Neutral**: Informative and concise

## Output

```markdown
## UX Copy: [Context]

### Recommended Copy
**[Element]**: [Copy]

### Alternatives
| Option | Copy | Tone | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| A | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |
| B | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |
| C | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |

### Rationale
[Why this copy works — user context, clarity, action-orientation]

### Localization Notes
[Anything translators should know — idioms to avoid, character expansion, cultural context]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Pull your brand voice guidelines and content style guide
- Check for existing copy patterns and terminology standards

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- View the screen context in Figma to understand the full user flow
- Check character limits and layout constraints from the design

## Tips

1. **Be specific about context** — "Error message when payment fails" is better than "error message."
2. **Share your brand voice** — "We're professional but warm" helps me match your tone.
3. **Consider the user's emotional state** — Error messages need empathy. Success messages can celebrate.$body$),

Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) or evaluate a system design.

## Usage

```
/architecture $ARGUMENTS
```

## Modes

**Create an ADR**: "Should we use Kafka or SQS for our event bus?"
**Evaluate a design**: "Review this microservices proposal"
**System design**: "Design the notification system for our app"

See the **system-design** skill for detailed frameworks on requirements gathering, scalability analysis, and trade-off evaluation.

## Output — ADR Format

# ADR-[number]: [Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date:** [Date]
**Deciders:** [Who needs to sign off]

## Context

## Trade-off Analysis
[Key trade-offs between options with clear reasoning]

## Consequences
- [What becomes easier]
- [What becomes harder]
- [What we'll need to revisit]

## Action Items
1. [ ] [Implementation step]
2. [ ] [Follow-up]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior ADRs and design docs
- Find relevant technical context

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link to related epics and tickets
- Create implementation tasks

## Tips

1. **State constraints upfront** — "We need to ship in 2 weeks" or "Must handle 10K rps" shapes the answer.
2. **Name your options** — Even if you're leaning one way, I'll give a more balanced analysis with explicit alternatives.
3. **Include non-functional requirements** — Latency, cost, team expertise, and maintenance burden matter as much as features.$body$),

## What I Need From You

Tell me about the problem. Any of these help:
- Error message or stack trace
- Steps to reproduce
- What changed recently
- Logs or screenshots
- Expected vs. actual behavior

## Output

```markdown
## Debug Report: [Issue Summary]

### Reproduction
- **Expected**: [What should happen]
- **Actual**: [What happens instead]
- **Steps**: [How to reproduce]

### Root Cause
[Explanation of why the bug occurs]

### Fix
[Code changes or configuration fixes needed]

### Prevention
- [Test to add]
- [Guard to put in place]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~monitoring** is connected:
- Pull logs, error rates, and metrics around the time of the issue
- Show recent deploys and config changes that may correlate

If **~~source control** is connected:
- Identify recent commits and PRs that touched affected code paths
- Check if the issue correlates with a specific change

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Search for related bug reports or known issues
- Create a ticket for the fix once identified

## Tips

1. **Share error messages exactly** — Don't paraphrase. The exact text matters.
2. **Mention what changed** — Recent deploys, dependency updates, and config changes are top suspects.
3. **Include context** — "This works in staging but not prod" or "Only affects large payloads" narrows things fast.$body$),

## Deploy Checklist: [Service/Release]
**Date:** [Date] | **Deployer:** [Name]

### Pre-Deploy
- [ ] All tests passing in CI
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No known critical bugs in release
- [ ] Database migrations tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Feature flags configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] On-call team notified

### Deploy
- [ ] Deploy to staging and verify
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Deploy to production (canary if available)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and latency for 15 min
- [ ] Verify key user flows

### Post-Deploy
- [ ] Confirm metrics are nominal
- [ ] Update release notes / changelog
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Close related tickets

### Rollback Triggers
- Error rate exceeds [X]%
- P50 latency exceeds [X]ms
- [Critical user flow] fails
```

## Customization

Tell me about your deploy and I'll customize the checklist:
- "We use feature flags" → adds flag verification steps
- "This includes a database migration" → adds migration-specific checks
- "This is a breaking API change" → adds consumer notification steps

## If Connectors Available

If **~~source control** is connected:
- Pull the release diff and list of changes
- Verify all PRs are approved and merged

If **~~CI/CD** is connected:
- Check build and test status automatically
- Verify pipeline is green before deploy

If **~~monitoring** is connected:
- Pre-fill rollback trigger thresholds from current baselines
- Set up post-deploy metric watch

## Tips

1. **Run before every deploy** — Even routine ones. Checklists prevent "I forgot to..."
2. **Customize once, reuse** — Tell me your stack and I'll remember your deploy process.
3. **Include rollback criteria** — Decide when to roll back before you deploy, not during.$body$),

Write clear, maintainable technical documentation for different audiences and purposes.

## Document Types

### README
- What this is and why it exists
- Quick start (< 5 minutes to first success)
- Configuration and usage
- Contributing guide

### API Documentation
- Endpoint reference with request/response examples
- Authentication and error codes
- Rate limits and pagination
- SDK examples

### Runbook
- When to use this runbook
- Prerequisites and access needed
- Step-by-step procedure
- Rollback steps
- Escalation path

### Architecture Doc
- Context and goals
- High-level design with diagrams
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Data flow and integration points

### Onboarding Guide
- Environment setup
- Key systems and how they connect
- Common tasks with walkthroughs
- Who to ask for what

## Principles

1. **Write for the reader** — Who is reading this and what do they need?
2. **Start with the most useful information** — Don't bury the lede
3. **Show, don't tell** — Code examples, commands, screenshots
4. **Keep it current** — Outdated docs are worse than no docs
5. **Link, don't duplicate** — Reference other docs instead of copying$body$)
